### About me :boy:

**I’m Yan, I’m from a Ukrain city Krivoy Rog.My knowledge in Web development started with Adobe Photoshop. I helped to create my friend panels of the user, icons and banners for this website. But all these elements were static. I wondered how I could change that. Search engines gave me three main directions for this purpose - html, css and javascript.**
**I found many relevant articles, books, communities, video. In my free time I studied these materials and tried to apply their knowledge in practice.**
**I like this profession, as it is closely related to sustainable development. Every day I learn something new and improve myself.**
**I am learning React at the moment.**
**I attend conferences, meetings.**
**I am looking for a place where I will be able to improve my knowledge and reach new heights...**
